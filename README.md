# Bikeshare Data Analysis Project

This project is part of Udacity's *Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree*.

The goal of this project is to explore data from three major US bike-share systems:
- New York City
- Chicago
- Washington

The script `bikeshare.py` allows users to:
- Filter data by city, month, and day
- Calculate statistics such as:
  - Most popular travel times
  - Most commonly used stations
  - Trip durations
  - User demographics
